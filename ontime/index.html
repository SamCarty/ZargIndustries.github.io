          <p>Ontime is developed by Zarg Industries as a free application that provides live train times in the United Kingdom. To help improve the application, we ask for your consent to collect information as set out in this privacy policy.
            <br><b>We promise not to sell any of your data to third parties.</b>
          </p>

          <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
          <p>We collect the following data:
            <ul>
              <li>Analytics data using Google Analytics. This service means we have a better idea as to who is using Ontime and will be used to improve the application in the future. For a complete list of the data collected using Google Analytics,
                please see
                <a target="_blank" href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039?hl=en">Google Analytics data collection</a>.</li>
              <li>Crash logs from your device using Google Firebase Crashlytics. This service allows us to fix problems with the application more quickly and provide a better overall user experience.</li>
              <li>The stations you travel from. This allows us to view where in the country our users are. It will be used to prioritize new feature additions within Ontime (eg. providing local transport timetable support).</li>
            </ul>
            We do not collect your exact location. Some features of Ontime use GPS services provided by Google including Google Location Services and Google Maps.
